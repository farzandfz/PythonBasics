#this is a variable
a=100

#this is a packed variable, we'll have to unpack everything, else python will get mad
#that's what I know as of now
x,y=(3,5)

print(x,y)
print(a)
print(y)

#variables were supposed to be simple, but this packing unpacking
#thing is making it comlicated, I'll figure it out later
